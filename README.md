## Steam Game Reviews Analysis

## Project Overview

Video games have become a significant part of global culture, evolving from a pastime to an influential industry impacting technology and social interactions. Platforms like **Steam** play a central role, offering not only game distribution but also features like community forums, in-game chat, and cloud storage. Steam has fostered a vibrant community where users share their gaming experiences through reviews, providing insights into player preferences, criticisms, and trends in gaming.

As data scientists hired by a leading Game Development Company, our objective is to analyze these reviews and answer key research questions. Our findings will help the company understand what players value in a video game, leading to better design, marketing strategies, and ultimately a more engaging user experience.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights from Steam game reviews. Specifically, we aim to:

1. Identify key factors that influence positive and negative reviews.
2. Discover common themes and trends across highly rated and poorly rated games.
3. Analyze the relationship between review length, sentiment, and user engagement.
4. Provide actionable recommendations based on player feedback to enhance future game development.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of **Steam game reviews** and includes the following key information:

- **Author**: Username of the reviewer.
- **Game**: The title of the game being reviewed.
- **Review Text**: Content of the review written by the user.
- **Review Date**: Date of the review.
- **Review Rating**: The rating given by the user (e.g., "positive" or "negative").
- **Playtime**: The amount of time the reviewer has spent playing the game.

The dataset reflects a diverse collection of reviews, capturing unique interactions between players and games. Each row represents one review.
