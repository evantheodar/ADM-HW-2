*The purpose of the project was to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis and answer below-mentioned research questions on a data collected from [Steam Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021) (2021)* 

The repository consists of the following files:
1. __`ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb`__:
       > A Jupyter notebook which provides the solutions to all research questions.

       1. [RQ1]: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

       2. [RQ2]: Let's explore the dataset by analyzing the distribution of reviews across different applications.

       3. [RQ3]: Understanding when users are most active in submitting reviews can help identify peak engagement periods.

       4. [RQ4]: Investigating whether users who spend more time using an application give higher or lower ratings

       5.[RQ5] It is interesting to explore the top reviewers to gain insight into their demographic location, the quality of their reviews, and the applications they tend to  review most frequently.
                                 
       6. [RQ6]: The behavior of specific groups, specifically focusing on English and Spanish reviewers
   
       7. [RQ7]: Certainly, calculating probabilities and conducting statistical tests are essential skills for any data scientist. Let's calculate some intriguing figures.

       8. [BONUS]

       9. [Algorithmic Question]

2. __`functions.py`__:
   > A python script which provides all the functions used in the `ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb` notebook.
